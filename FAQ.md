Here you can find answers to the most common questions about MicroMind.

## Subscription & Billing

### How do I cancel my subscription?
Since MicroMind subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you must cancel directly through your device settings.
*   **iOS:** Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions > MicroMind > Cancel.
*   **Android:** Google Play Store > Profile > Payments & subscriptions > Subscriptions > MicroMind > Cancel.

### Can I get a refund?
**No.** As stated in our [Refund Policy](REFUND_POLICY.md), all sales are final. We do not offer refunds for partial subscription periods or unused services. If you have an issue with a purchase made via the App Store or Play Store, you must contact them directly, as we do not have control over their billing systems.

### Does the app work offline?
Yes! MicroMind is designed to store your data locally on your device, so you can use it without an internet connection. Some features (like AI processing) may require an internet connection.

## Account & Privacy

### Where is my data stored?
Your tasks and personal data are primarily stored locally on your device. We prioritize your privacy and do not sell your data to third parties. Please review our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for more details.

### How do I delete my account/data?
You can delete your local data by uninstalling the app. If you have created a cloud-synced account (if applicable), look for the "Delete Account" option in the Settings menu within the app.
