# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026**

**STRICT NO REFUND POLICY**

At MicroMind, we are committed to providing a high-quality service to help you manage your tasks and productivity. However, due to the nature of our digital products and services, we maintain a **strict no-refund policy** on all purchases.

## 1. All Sales Are Final
All purchases made through the MicroMind application, including but not limited to subscriptions, lifetime access, and in-app purchases, are final and non-refundable.

**WE DO NOT OFFER REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS OR UNUSED SERVICES.**

## 2. Subscription Cancellations
You may cancel your subscription at any time. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period. However, you will **not** receive a refund for any remaining portion of the subscription fee you have already paid.

## 3. In-App Purchases (Apple App Store / Google Play Store)
If you made a purchase through a third-party app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store), your purchase is subject to that store's refund policy. While we maintain a strict no-refund policy, these third-party platforms may have their own terms regarding refunds. We cannot process refunds for purchases made through third-party stores; you must contact the respective store support directly.
